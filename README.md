# 30-Day Social Skills Challenge

A web application designed to help users improve their social skills through a structured 30-day challenge. Each day presents reading materials and practical challenges to build confidence and social competence.

## Inspiration and Adaptation

This project is inspired by Neil Strauss's book "The Stylelife Challenge: Master the Game in 30 Days". While the original book focused on dating and relationships, this adaptation has been reimagined to focus purely on social skills development and personal growth.

### Important Note
This project is a personal adaptation created out of appreciation for the valuable social skills concepts presented in the original work. It has been significantly modified to:
- Remove dating-specific content
- Focus on general social skills and personal development
- Adapt challenges to be more broadly applicable
- Create a more inclusive and accessible learning experience

The original book's teachings helped many people, including myself, develop better social skills. This project aims to share these valuable lessons in a new context, focusing on the universal aspects of social interaction and personal growth.
