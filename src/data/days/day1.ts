Your instructions are simple: 

Every morning, as soon as you wake up, read your missions for the day. They may be primers to study, questions to answer, self-improvement exercises to perform or field exercises to get you out of the house and approach people. They begin at a very basic level and grow more advanced as the 30-Day Challenge continues. Think of it as a fitness program for your social life.

If you want to take the most from the Challenge, it's important that you complete all
of the missions in the order they are presented. Do not read ahead. Some exercises may seem basic; others may seem out of character for you. But each new
exercise builds upon the last, so stick with it.
Several missions will require you to read certain guides and articles. Make sure that you read each briefing before proceeding to any corresponding field assignments.


The only other material you need will be a pen and a journal, to keep track of your answers. Access to a mirror and to your phone (for recording your voice) will be also useful for a few assignments. 

Each day you'll do a few small things that can change your life in the long run. None of these assignments requires much more than an hour, so even if you're working three jobs, you should still be able to do them all.

## How to Win the Game

You win when, at any point between Day 1 and Day 30, you **make a new friend**. A new friend is defined as a planned second encounter with a person you have just met. For example, if you approach a person at a coffee shop, exchange contact information, and meet them for an activity two days later, that is a new friendship. If you talk to someone at the mall and arrange to meet that night at a social event, and they show up specifically to see you, that is a new friendship. Even if you don't exchange contact information. Basically, any scenario where you approach a person and they agree to see you at a later date or time — and shows up — constitutes a new friendship.

Once you make a new friend, feel free to put your name in the winner's circle at [https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/workshops/social/](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/workshops/social/) and share your story. If you win before the thirty days are up, feel free to continue the Challenge and carry out the daily missions for the remainder of the month. They'll only further enhance your confidence and social skills. 

Enjoy, and play fair.

# Day 1 Briefing: The Chains That Bind

When it came to meeting new people, my biggest enemy was me. I used to look at myself and think there was no way I could connect with all the outgoing, popular people out there.

But once I started approaching people in streets, cafes, university, and other social places, I discovered that being outgoing doesn't matter nearly as much as I'd thought. As long as I was genuine and friendly, all I needed to make new friends was the right mindset.


## Limiting Beliefs

A limiting belief is something that you believe about yourself, other people, or the world—and although it isn't actually true, the fact that you think it is holds you back from experience and success. Any time you tell yourself you "can't" do something that's within the realm of human possibility—that's a limiting belief.

Dispelling limiting beliefs is very easy: just ask yourself, "Was there ever a time when..."  and insert the opposite of your limiting belief. For example, if you believe that you get uncomfortable around people, ask yourself, "Was there ever a time when I was comfortable around a person?"

Name just one time, and you've disproved your limiting belief.

---

Nearly everyone is held back by some limiting belief, whether one is conscious of it or not. So before I send you running around the streets talking to strangers, let's clear the air and dispel a few of the most common limiting beliefs about socializing.

**LIMITING BELIEF: If I talk to them, they'll ignore me—or, even worse, say something mean that will embarrass me.**

**REALITY:** Here's something that may surprise you: The harder it is for you to approach people, the less likely it is that you'll be rudely rejected. Why is that? Because most people have been raised to be courteous and polite, unless they feel threatened—and a shy person isn't too likely to intimidate anyone. The worst thing that's likely to happen is the person will politely say they're having a private conversation, or simply excuse themselves to go to the restroom. Playing negative what-if scenarios in your head is detrimental to your emotional health. Instead, get out of the house and start approaching people, and you'll discover that most of the things you imagine going wrong will never happen.

**LIMITING BELIEF: People are looking at me, judging me, or making fun of me.**

**REALITY:** This is half right. People may notice you, but they're not necessarily judging you—most of them are too busy worrying about what other people are thinking of them. Once you realize that most people are just like you—and that they're actually seeking your approval—you'll start to become socially fearless. Besides, most bystanders who see you approach a person or a group assume that you know the people. So act like you do. Not only will it ease your worries about what everyone else is thinking, but it'll also make your approach more effective.

**LIMITING BELIEF: People aren't attracted to shy individuals. They like outgoing people.**

**REALITY:** This is one of the oldest myths about socializing. And, fortunately, it's inaccurate. The social dichotomy isn't actually between shy people and outgoing people, or quiet individuals and talkative individuals. It's between weak individuals and strong individuals. People are drawn to those who demonstrate strength—not necessarily physical strength, but the ability to make others feel safe and comfortable. So if you're a shy person, you can still be shy. But you must also be strong. However, make sure you know what shy means. Some people who define themselves as "too shy" only behave like so because they want everybody to like them and don't want anyone to think badly of them - therefore avoiding talking and giving their opinion. So, if this is you, get off your nice high horse. Don't mistake being fearful and weak-minded for being shy.

**LIMITING BELIEF: I'm not good-looking, rich, or famous enough to be friends with social people.**

**REALITY:** There are plenty of rock stars and multimillionaires who have the exact same problems with socializing that you do. Neil, the author of the original 30-Day Challenge, actually knows this because he has coached many of them. And, in the process, he learned that money, looks, and fame—while they certainly make things much easier—aren't actually necessary. Fortunately for everyone, the way we look doesn't matter nearly as much as how we present ourselves. And this essentially requires only good grooming. When it comes to wealth and fame, simply displaying the desire and ability to achieve them can be just as powerful. Like talent scouts, many people are attracted to individuals with goals and potential.

**LIMITING BELIEF: There's this one person...**

**REALITY:** There are many incredible people in this world. If you're hung up on one particular person you just can't get out of your mind—and they haven't given you any sense that they share the feelings—then recognize that's not genuine connection you're feeling, but obsession. And that obsession is likely to scare them away. The best thing you can do for yourself and for them is to go out and interact with as many people as possible, until you realize that there are plenty of people out there for you—some of whom are capable of recognizing your worth and reciprocating your feelings.

**LIMITING BELIEF: Some people are born with the ability to charm others. Other people just don't have it and never will.**

**REALITY:** Fortunately, there is a third type of person: one who can learn it. That's me. And once you understand how social attraction works and have a few successful approaches under your belt, it'll be you too. Any problems you may currently be having aren't the result of who you are but of what you're doing and how you're presenting yourself. Those problems can be fixed easily with the right knowledge and a little practice. If you stick with the Challenge, you'll even start doing better than the so-called naturals you once envied.

**LIMITING BELIEF: All I have to do is "be myself," and eventually I'll meet the right person who likes me for me.**

**REALITY:** This works only if you know exactly who you are, what your strengths are, and how to convey them successfully. Most often, this statement is used as an excuse not to improve. What most people present to the world isn't necessarily their true self: it's a combination of years of bad habits and fear-based behavior. Our real self lies buried underneath all the insecurities and inhibitions. So rather than just being yourself, focus on discovering and permanently bringing to the surface your best self.

**LIMITING BELIEF: To figure out what people want, just ask them.**

**REALITY:** This may be true sometimes, but not as often as many people think. It wasn't until I started trying behaviors that seemed counterintuitive that I discovered a key principle of the game: What people say they want isn't necessarily what they respond to. Furthermore, what people say they want may be what they want in a long-term relationship , but it isn't always what attracts them during the initial courtship period. That said, most people will give you the information you need to attract them, but it's usually found between the lines.

**LIMITING BELIEF: If I approach someone, they'll know I'm trying to befriend them and think I'm too needy.**

**REALITY:** This is only partially true—people think this only when others approach them badly. This includes individuals who make them uncomfortable, creep them out, or seem to have an agenda. The biggest mistake a person can make with another is trying to befriend them before they're interested. And though this describes the so-called technique of most people, it's a mistake you'll avoid if you follow your daily missions. Few people will resent meeting someone who is warm, funny, sincere, interesting, engaging, makes them feel comfortable, and isn't going to stick around talking their ear off.

**LIMITING BELIEF: Some people don't enjoy social interaction as much as others. They're mostly interested in solitary activities.**

**REALITY:** If you believe that, you might be missing a key insight about human nature: It's common for people to have a deep-seated need for connection and belonging. Most individuals enjoy a variety of activities, both solitary and social, but in short, positive social interaction can be incredibly enriching and beneficial for almost everyone. Doesn't that make seeking it out a logical desire?`,

  challenge: `# Day 1 Challenges

## Mission 1: Evaluate Yourself
Fitness programs require you to weigh in on the first day. Financial plans ask
for a list of your assets and debts. So to revamp your social life, you'll need to
make a social assessment of yourself.
Your first mission is to write answers (time to use your journal!) to the following questions. Don't worry
about what anyone else will think of your answers. Your goal is to be as _honest_
with yourself as possible.

1. Write one or two sentences describing how you believe other people currently perceive you.
\`\`\` 

\`\`\`

2. Write one or two sentences describing how you'd like to be perceived by others.

\`\`\` 

\`\`\`

3. List three of your behaviors or characteristics you would like to change.
\`\`\` 

\`\`\`

4. List three new behaviors or characteristics you would like to adopt.
\`\`\` 

\`\`\`

## Mission 3: Operation Small Talk
Your first field assignment: Make small talk with five strangers today.

It doesn't matter whether they're male or female, young or old, friendly or unfriendly. The stranger can be a classmate, someone in the library, a person at the bus stop, or someone in line at the cafeteria.

The goal is simply to start a conversation, with no intent other than filling in the silence with a question or pleasantry. The conversation doesn't have to progress beyond a comment and a response.

### Small-talk topics include:
- Weather: 'It's beautiful out today. Too bad we're stuck inside."
- Sports: "Did you catch the game last night? I couldn't believe it."
- Current events: "Did you hear that ____ ? What are they going to think of next?"
- Entertainment: "Have you seen the new movie yet? I wonder if it's any good."

**⚠️Remember:** The answer doesn't matter. Whether you receive a long story or a cursory grunt in response, you've completed the mission simply by opening your mouth and speaking to a stranger.`,
